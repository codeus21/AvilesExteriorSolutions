# Fixing Sitemap 404 Error

## ‚úÖ Good News!
Your sitemap IS being built correctly. I can see `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are in your `dist` folder after building.

## üî¥ The Problem
The 404 error happens because **your site isn't deployed yet** or **the deployment hasn't updated** with the new sitemap.

Google Search Console can only access files that are **live on your website**.

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Your Site First (Recommended)

**If using Vercel:**
1. Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub/GitLab/etc
2. Connect your repo to Vercel (if not already)
3. Deploy the site: `vercel --prod` (or push to main branch if auto-deploy is enabled)
4. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
5. **Then** submit your sitemap in Google Search Console

**After deployment, your sitemap will be at:**
- `https://avilesexterior.com/sitemap.xml` (or your actual domain)

**Test it first:** Before submitting to Google, open this URL in your browser to make sure it works:
- `https://avilesexterior.com/sitemap.xml`

You should see the XML file. If you see it, Google can see it too!

### Option 2: Test Locally First (To Verify It Works)

1. **Build the site** (already done):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Preview locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   
3. **Open in browser:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:4173/sitemap.xml`
   - You should see your sitemap XML
   - This confirms the sitemap is built correctly

4. **Then deploy** and submit the sitemap

### Option 3: If Already Deployed - Rebuild & Redeploy

If your site is already live:
1. Make sure you've built: `npm run build`
2. Deploy again: `vercel --prod` (or push to trigger deployment)
3. Wait for deployment
4. Test: `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
5. Then submit to Google Search Console

## üéØ Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Deploy your site** (using your hosting platform)
   - Vercel: Push to GitHub or run `vercel --prod`
   - Netlify: Push to connected repo or drag & drop dist folder
   - Other: Upload dist folder contents to your web server

2. **Verify sitemap is live**:
   - Open: `https://avilesexterior.com/sitemap.xml` in your browser
   - You should see the XML content (not a 404 page)

3. **Then submit to Google**:
   - Go to Google Search Console
   - Sitemaps section
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click Submit
   - Should work now! ‚úÖ

## üîç Troubleshooting

**Still getting 404 after deployment?**

1. **Check the URL** - Make sure you're using the exact URL:
   - ‚úÖ `https://avilesexterior.com/sitemap.xml`
   - ‚ùå `https://avilesexterior.com/public/sitemap.xml` (wrong!)
   - ‚ùå `https://avilesexterior.com/src/sitemap.xml` (wrong!)

2. **Check file permissions** - Make sure the file isn't blocked by server rules

3. **Wait a few minutes** - Sometimes DNS/caching takes a moment

4. **Check if site is actually live**:
   - Can you visit `https://avilesexterior.com` and see your site?
   - If yes, the sitemap should be at `https://avilesexterior.com/sitemap.xml`

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Site is built (`npm run build` - ‚úÖ already done)
- [ ] Site is deployed to production
- [ ] Can access `https://avilesexterior.com` in browser
- [ ] Can access `https://avilesexterior.com/sitemap.xml` in browser (shows XML)
- [ ] Then submit `sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console

**Your sitemap file is correctly configured. Once your site is deployed live, it will work perfectly!**
