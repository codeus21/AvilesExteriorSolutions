              <p>
                Founded with a passion for creating beautiful outdoor spaces, Aviles Exterior Services 
                has been serving residential and commercial clients for over 5 years. Based in Douglasville, GA, 
                we started as a small family business with a simple mission: to transform yards and outdoor 
                areas into stunning, well-maintained spaces that property owners can be proud of.
              </p>
              <p>
                What began as a local lawn care service has grown into a comprehensive exterior solutions 
                company. We specialize in lawn care, landscaping, bush and hedge trimming, house washing, 
                and complete yard maintenance. Our commitment to quality workmanship and exceptional customer 
                service has helped us transform over 100 yards throughout the region.
